# Mailman
Discord bot for verifying users in a server. Made with [**discord.js**](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [**nodemailer**](https://nodemailer.com/).

### About
Mailman is able to verify users in a server by sending them a verification code via email. The user can then enter the code in Discord to verify themselves. This helps to prevent **raids** and **spam** in your server.

Have a private community? Only want to restrict the server to a certain organisation? With Mailman, you can restrict access to your server to **only verified users** with a **certain email domain**.

### Usage
